## String Parsing / Simulation


Below code is generated by ChatGPT. It solves two problems described in the `02_09_2026_technically_wrong.py`. Note that we perform the clamp check with `if` condition before the overflow would happen. Esplecially, for the second part of the `if` condition, `(ans == INT_MAX // 10 and digit > INT_MAX % 10)`, it becomse `False` if the input is `INT_MAX` and `True` if the input is `INT_MIN` (These two conditions are the edge cases).

- TC: $O(n)$, where $n$ is the length of the input string `s`.
- SC: $O(1)$


```python
class Solution:
    def myAtoi(self, s: str) -> int:
        INT_MIN, INT_MAX = -2**31, 2**31 - 1

        i, n = 0, len(s)

        # 1) skip leading spaces
        while i < n and s[i] == " ":
            i += 1

        # 2) sign
        sign = 1
        if i < n and s[i] in "+-":
            if s[i] == "-":
                sign = -1
            i += 1

        # 3) digits
        ans = 0
        while i < n and "0" <= s[i] <= "9":
            digit = ord(s[i]) - ord("0")

            # 4) clamp check BEFORE overflow would happen
            if ans > INT_MAX // 10 or (ans == INT_MAX // 10 and digit > INT_MAX % 10):
                return INT_MAX if sign == 1 else INT_MIN

            ans = ans * 10 + digit
            i += 1

        return sign * ans
