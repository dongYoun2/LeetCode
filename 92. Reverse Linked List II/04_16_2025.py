# TC: O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the linked list
# SC: O(n) (for the `nodes` list)

# From LeetCode Top Interview 150 - Linekd List

# The problem was quite tricky and confusing. At first, I tried to implement it in one pass without using extra space (The logic and the code were similar to the C code in the markdown file). However, debugging a null pointer when the left (and also right) is at the left-end (and right-end for the right pointer) was very confusing. It took too much time, and I failed to do so.

# So, I decided to use extra space with an array, which provides the convenience of accessing the nodes by their index. I'm not sure if this is a good practice for solving linked list problems. I will try solving this problem again later without additional space.

# LeetCode Editorial provides two solutions: a Recursive method (Approach 1) and a one-pass iterative method (Approach 2). The recursive method uses O(n) space due to the recursion stack, whereas the iterative method uses O(1) space. Although this iterative method and the C code in the markdown file are both one-pass with constant space, the implementation details are slightly different. For more details, refer to the LeetCode Editorial and the markdown file.

# cf.) I don't really like linked list problems â€” they are pretty confusing :(

        for i in range(left, right + 1):
