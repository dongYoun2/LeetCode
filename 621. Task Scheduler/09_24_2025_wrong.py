# wrong Solution

# 31 min

# idea was that we can place "all" of the tasks with the highest frequency first, then fill the IDLE slots if needed. i repeated this process until all the tasks are placed while keeping track of the count of tasks.

# however, we can easily notice that this approach doesn't work for the failed test case in the submission link.
