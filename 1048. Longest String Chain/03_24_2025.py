# TC: O(N*log N + N^2*L) -> O(N^2*L), where N is the number of words and L is the maximum word length. (N*log N for sorting, and L for predecessor checking with two-pointer algorithm.) However, time complexity can be further optmized to O(N*L^2); see the explanation in the markdown file.
# SC: O(N) (hash table)

# As soon as I saw this question, I felt it was a dynamic programming problem, so I assumed it so. Since the maximum number of words is 1K from the constraint, I assumed that the time complexity has to be similar to O(N^2).

# I also thought maybe this was a topological sorting problem (In my notes, I was trying to see if topological sorting works). I assumed that checking only the nodes (words) in the last level was sufficient. However, I realized that there can be a word chain with the current word constructed on top of the node (word) from the previous levels.

# Turning back to the DP algorithm, I found out that the word chain for the current word can be constructed by adding this word to any word chain with the last word's length as the `len(current_word) - 1` (Need to check only these words). Therefore, this can be stored in a hash map where the "key" is the word length, and the "value" is the tuple of 1) the word itself and 2) the maximum length of the word chain.

# To check whether the potential predecessors (all previous words with length len(current_word) - 1) are actual predecessors of the current word, I used a two-pointer algorithm, which has a time complexity of O(L). In this setting, by keeping track of the maximum length of the word chain, the answer could be found.

# However, this solution is suboptimal when there exist many words of the same length. In this case, the hasp map is skewed â€” leading to the worst-case time complexity, O(N^2*L).
